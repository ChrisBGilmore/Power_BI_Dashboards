### 💡 Credits & Acknowledgements

This project was built as part of the **"Power BI for Data Analytics"** course by **Luke Barousse**. 

* **Course Link:** [Power BI for Data Analytics - Full Course for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FwjaHCVNBWA)
* **Data Source:** The dataset was provided as part of the course materials, featuring real-world 2024 job postings.

While following the course framework, I implemented the ETL logic, DAX measures, and dashboard design to reinforce my end-to-end Power BI development skills.

Executive Insights: High-level monitoring of $109.81M in sales and 121K orders with efficiency benchmarking.

Product Diagnostics: Advanced scatter plot quadrant analysis used to identify "Underperformer" vs. "Star" products.

### Key Power BI Skills Utilized
💰 Financial Logic: Created DAX measures for Total Sales, Gross Profit, and Margins.

📈 Efficiency Benchmarking: Identified high-margin categories using Bar & Combo charts.

📍 Quadrant Analysis: Used Scatter Plots to categorize product performance.

🔄 Interactive Flow: Configured Drill-Throughs to navigate from summary to diagnostic views.

🏷️ Dynamic UI: Developed DAX-driven titles that update based on user filters.

### 3\. Telecom Analysis: Customer Retention & Revenue Protection

![Telecom_page1](/Images/TelecomChurn_page1.png)

Strategic Focus: Transforming usage patterns and service interactions into a "Proactive Retention" tool to mitigate customer attrition and protect at-risk revenue.

Executive Insights
High-Level Monitoring: Tracking the health of a 2.67K customer base with a specialized focus on the 14.55% churn rate.

Revenue at Risk: Quantified the financial impact of churn by aggregating disparate usage charges into a $25K Total Revenue Lost metric.

Geographic Hot-Spotting: Identified the "Top 5" underperforming states by churn rate to allow for regional-specific retention strategies.

### Key Power BI Skills Utilized
💰 Financial Impact Logic: Developed complex SUMX DAX measures to calculate revenue loss for churned customers. 

📞 Behavioral Segmentation: Utilized bucketization to identify a "Service Cliff," proving that churn risk hits ~60% after the 3rd support call.

🔄 Interactive Flow & State Management: Implemented Bookmark-driven Reset buttons and a centralized control center for Area Code and State slicers.

🏷️ Dynamic UI & Tooltips: Developed a Report Page Tooltip for the map visual, providing a "Deep Dive" into regional churn drivers without cluttering the main view.

📈 Life-Cycle Analysis: Used Line Charts to pinpoint a critical churn spike during the 13-24 month tenure window, identifying the "Second-Year Slump."

###  4\. Rotten Tomatoes Cinema Analytics: Critic vs. Audience Sentiment
![media_page1](/Images/Media_page1.png)

Strategic Focus: Analyzing the divergent perspectives of professional critics and general audiences to identify "Cult Classics," "Oscar Bait," and century-long quality trends in film and television.

Executive Insights

Dual-Lens Sentiment Tracking: Developed a unified engine to monitor 3.4K titles, allowing stakeholders to pivot the entire report between Critic and Audience perspectives.

The "Polarization" Index: Quantified "Critical Discord" by building an absolute error measure to identify titles where public and professional opinions differ by over 50%.

Historical Quality Narratives: Transitioned from noisy yearly data to Decadal Smoothing to visualize the evolution of genres from the Silent Era (1920s) to the Modern Streaming Era.

### Key Power BI Skills Utilized
🎭 Metric Switching (Field Parameters): Engineered dynamic DAX logic that swaps all visuals and calculations on the fly based on the user's selection of "Critic" or "Audience" scores.

⚖️ Sentiment Gap Analysis: Authored custom DAX to filter for "Ghost Gaps"—ensuring movies missing one side of the data don't skew the "Most Controversial" rankings.

🖥️ Advanced UX/UI "App" Design: Developed a high-contrast dark theme using rounded containers and neon-blue borders to simulate a modern streaming interface.

🎛️ Dynamic Threshold Navigation: Built a Numeric Range Parameter dropdown that acts as an "Elite Filter," allowing users to instantly isolate movies with 90%+ ratings across any genre.

🔍 Advanced Drill-Through: Built a genre deep-dive layer to find top reviewed movie/shows for any genre as well as exploring historical trends.

### 5\. Sales Scenario & Forecasting Engine

![forecasting_page1](/Images/Predictions_1.png)

Strategic Focus: Transforming historical sales data into a forward-looking decision tool that identifies revenue gaps and utilizes "What-If" parameters to simulate growth impact across regions and product categories.

Executive Insights
Dynamic Growth Simulation: Engineered a real-time adjustment engine that allows stakeholders to simulate various growth percentages, instantly quantifying the dollar-value impact on year-end targets.

The "Gap to Goal" Logic: Developed a binary status tracker that compares adjusted forecasts against a $2.83M revenue floor to provide immediate "Goal Achieved" or "At Risk" feedback.

Structural Performance Drivers: Utilized hierarchical decomposition to identify that the Technology category in the West region serves as the primary engine for forecasted success.

### Key Power BI Skills Utilized
🕹️ Interactive Scenario Modeling (What-If): Implemented Numeric Parameters linked to custom DAX measures, allowing the entire dashboard to react dynamically to user-defined growth inputs.

📈 Time-Series Forecasting: Leveraged built-in AI forecasting models to project 2019 sales trajectories based on historical seasonality and cyclical trends.

🎨 High-Fidelity UI/UX Design: Built a sophisticated dark-mode "App-style" interface using rounded containers, high-contrast gold/cyan accents, and a Z-pattern layout for optimal readability.

🏷️ Conditional Logic & Dynamic Titles: Authored DAX-driven titles and KPI cards that update their text and colors based on the data, ensuring the "Analysis" context is never lost during filtering.

🌳 Advanced Drill-Down (Decomposition Tree): Configured AI-powered root-cause visuals to break down complex sales predictions into digestible regional and categorical insights.
