## Introduction
Navigating the data job market is often overwhelming due to fragmented information across multiple platforms. This dashboard was developed for Job Seekers, Career Transitioners, and Analysts to centralize market intelligence.

Using a real-world dataset of 2024 job postings, this project provides an interactive interface to explore compensation benchmarks, geographic hubs, and the technical skills currently in highest demand.

# 🛠️ Skills Showcased
Data Transformation (ETL): Leveraged Power Query to clean, shape, and normalize raw job posting data for accurate analysis.

Advanced Data Visualization: Utilized Column, Bar, Line, and Area Charts to compare job volumes and track historical trends.

Business Logic & KPIs: Implemented Card visuals for high-level metrics and detailed Tables for granular data exploration.

User-Centric Design: Focused on an intuitive UI, balancing visual variety with clarity to ensure the "data story" is easy to follow.

Interactive Reporting:

Slicers: For dynamic filtering by job title and seniority

Buttons & Bookmarks: For a seamless, application-like navigation experience.

Drill-Through: Enabling users to transition from a high-level market summary to specific product/role details.
